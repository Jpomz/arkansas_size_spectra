# 1 - Download and wrangle Neon Data

# this is the script that was used to download the data presented in the manuscript. 

# However, the NEON dataportal is live, and data may be updated or ammended in the future. I include this script here for future use, and to aid in the access to NEON data. 

### PLEASE NOTE ###
# If you would like to recreate the results presented in the manuscript, I recommend you DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT!

# instead, you can work directly with the data used for the analysis by downloading it from [<insert data dryad URL here once archived>] and skipping to script 2_mle_bin_full_data.R
