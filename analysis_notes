Analysis update, July 2023

began analysis using Wesner's isdBayes package
On my local copy of isdbayes project, I have an "ark_data.R" script. Need to move that to this repo, along with custom functions from Jeff to reproduce analysis in this rep. 

Moved files over, haven't run yet to see if I got the write stuff or not
